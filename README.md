My intention is to build a programming language in Greek.

My First Dilemmas are:

1. Compiler? Interpreter? or Both?
2. Ancient Greek ? Simplified New Greek? Greeklish?
3. General Purpose Lang (compiles and runs on computers as python)
4. Fontend Support (As Typescript)
5. Built on top of another lang as parser or from scratch
6. Proof that can address complex conditionals or iterations
