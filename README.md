My intention is to build a programming language in Greek.

My First Dilemmas are:

1. Compiler? Interpreter? Both? or None?
2. Ancient Greek ? Simplified New Greek? Greeklish?
3. General Purpose Lang (compiles and runs on computers as python)
4. Build as a Framework using another lang eg. PHP,PYTHON,C#,JS ?
5. Proof that can address complex conditionals or iterations
6. which programming language to use? C? C++? JS? PHP? PYTHON?
7. receive support from a testing framework eg. PHPSPEC
